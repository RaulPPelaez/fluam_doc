abstract = "We develop an inertial coupling method for modeling the dynamics of point-like “blob” particles immersed in an incompressible fluid, generalizing previous work for compressible fluids (Balboa Usabiaga et al., 2013 [42]). The coupling consistently includes excess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the displaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum equation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the formulation obeys a fluctuation–dissipation balance, owing to the non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal discretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the continuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and spreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in immersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels allow the blob to provide an effective model of a particle; specifically, the volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties of the blob are remarkably grid-independent. We develop a second-order semi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete fluctuation–dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity. Furthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and Helmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based implementation on GPUs. We numerically investigate the performance of the method on several standard test problems. In the deterministic setting, we find the blob to be a remarkably robust approximation to a rigid sphere, at both low and high Reynolds numbers. In the stochastic setting, we study in detail the short and long-time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function and observe agreement with all of the known behavior for rigid sphere immersed in a fluctuating fluid. The proposed inertial coupling method provides a low-cost coarse-grained (minimal resolution) model of particulate flows over a wide range of time-scales ranging from Brownian to convection-driven motion."

	annote = {We study diffusion of colloids on a fluid–fluid interface using particle simulations and fluctuating hydrodynamics. Diffusion on a two-dimensional interface with three-dimensional hydrodynamics is known to be anomalous, with the collective diffusion coefficient diverging like the inverse of the wavenumber. This unusual collective effect arises because of the compressibility of the fluid flow in the plane of the interface, and leads to a nonlinear nonlocal convolution term in the diffusion equation for the ensemble-averaged concentration. We extend the previous hydrodynamic theory to account for a species/color labeling of the particles, as necessary to model experiments based on fluorescent techniques. We study the magnitude and dynamics of density and color density fluctuations using a novel Brownian dynamics algorithm, as well as fluctuating hydrodynamics theory and simulation. We find that hydrodynamic coupling between a single tagged particle and collective density fluctuations leads to a reduction of the long-time self-diffusion coefficient, even for an ideal gas of non-interacting particles. This unexpected finding demonstrates that density functional theories that do not account for thermal fluctuations are incomplete even for ideal systems. Using linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, we show that for diffusion on a fluid–fluid interface, nonequilibrium fluctuations of the total density are small compared to the equilibrium fluctuations, but fluctuations of color density are giant and exhibit a spectrum that decays as the inverse cubed power of the wavenumber. We confirm these predictions through Brownian dynamics simulations of diffusive mixing with two indistinguishable species. We also examine nonequilibrium fluctuations in systems with two-dimensional hydrodynamics, such as thin smectic films in vacuum. We find that nonequilibrium fluctuations are colossal and comparable in magnitude to the mean, and can be accurately modeled using numerical solvers for the nonlinear equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.}
